## Introduction

The Student Performance Analysis in R project focuses on examining the relationship between different variables and student performance. By leveraging the power of R, we can efficiently process and analyze large datasets to extract meaningful information and draw valuable conclusions.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/anushkashankarr/StudentsPerformanceAnalysis.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd StudentsPerformanceAnalysis`


## Data

The dataset used in this project contains information about various factors that may influence student performance, such as demographics, family background, study habits, and test scores. The dataset is provided as a CSV file named `students_data.csv` in the `data` directory.

Make sure the dataset is in the correct format, with each column representing a variable and each row representing a student's record.

## Analysis

The analysis script, `analysis.R`, performs a comprehensive analysis of the student performance dataset. It includes steps such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical tests, and modeling. You can customize the script to suit your specific analysis requirements.

The script provides several functions to load the dataset, preprocess the data, perform statistical analysis, visualize results, and generate reports.

## Results

The results of the analysis are presented in various formats, including visualizations and summary statistics. These outcomes provide insights into the relationships between different variables and student performance.
